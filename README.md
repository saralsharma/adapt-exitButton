# adapt-exitButton
<p>This Exit button is an extention which comes up at the top-right corner of the page in main menu and before the progress bar in section. It exits the course if the course is launched in new popup window. This improves user experience especially in mobile devices where the brwoser doesn't have upfront visible exit button.</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saralsharma/adapt-exitButton/master/exitButton-component-screenshot.jpg" alt="Adapt-exitButton component screenshot"/>
